## HTBoost Tutorials

- For R users, I recommend to start with [Installation and use in R](tutorials_R/Installation_and_use_in_R.md) and [Basic use](tutorials_R/Basic_use.md).  
- Only a few tutorials are provided for R. For more tutorials and examples, see [Julia tutorials](Tutorials.md) and [Julia examples](Examples.md), using the guidelines in [Installation and use in R](Installation_and_use_in_R.md) to adapt the code to R.

### R tutorials 

  * [Basic use](tutorials/Basic_use.md) (main options, cv, savings and loading results, variable importance and more post-estimation analysis)
  * [Time series and panels](tutorials/Time_series_and_panels.md) (Data Frames, time series and panels/longitudinal data, with various options for cv)
