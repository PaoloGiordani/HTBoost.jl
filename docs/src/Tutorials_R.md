## HTBoost Tutorials

- For R users, I recommend starting with [Installation and use in R](tutorials_R/Installation_and_use_in_R.md) and [Basic use](tutorials_R/Basic_use.md).  
- Only a few tutorials are provided for R. For more tutorials and examples, see [Julia tutorials](Tutorials.md) and [Julia examples](Examples.md), using the guidelines in [Installation and use in R](tutorials_R/Installation_and_use_in_R.md) to adapt the code to R. 

### R tutorials 

  * [Installation and use in R](tutorials_R/Installation_and_use_in_R.md)
  * [Basic use](tutorials_R/Basic_use.md) (main options, cv, savings and loading results, variable importance and more post-estimation analysis)
  * [Time series and panels](tutorials_R/Time_series_and_panels.md) (Data Frames, time series and panels/longitudinal data, with various options for cv)
  * [Categorical features](tutorials_R/Categoricals.md) (how HTBoost handles categorical features; comparison with LightGBM and CatBoost)
