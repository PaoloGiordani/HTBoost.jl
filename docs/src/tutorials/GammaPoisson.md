## Poisson and GammaPoisson for (possibly overdisperesed) count data

XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost offer the Poisson loss for count data.
The Poisson distribution assumes that var(*y*|x) = E(*y*|x), a restriction that is often violated in practice.
Besides loss = :Poisson, HTBoost proposes the more general :gammaPoisson (aka negative binomial), a popular generalization of the Poisson in statistics. The gamma Poisson introduces an additional parameter α (the 'overdispersion' parameter), where now *E(y)=μ, var(y)=μ(1+αμ)*. The Poisson is recovered for  α -> 0. 

HTBoost estimates α internally by maximum likelihood after each tree. The final value of α can be recovered by *HTBcoeff( )* as follows:

```julia

param  = HTBparam(loss=:gammaPoisson)
data   = HTBdata(y,x,param)
output = HTBfit(data,param)
HTBcoeff(output)

```

See [GammaPoisson.jl](../examples/gammaPoisson.jl) for a fully worked-out example, including a comparison with LightGBM (with Poisson loss).  
In that example, the data is generated by a gamma Poisson (negative binomial), and HTBoost provides a consistent estimate of both α and E(y|x).
